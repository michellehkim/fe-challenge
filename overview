I started this challenge from scratch and created a new Github page for my work. 
I was having trouble figuring out Github which caused me to spend a great amount of time on this..besides that, here are a few challenges I faced during this project. 

At the start, I could not get my css and html to connect. This was quickly resloved by checking correcting the stylesheet name.
Next, I changed the "mins" and "resumes" of the frequency to another line (h3) in order to change the font size accordingly.

Lastly, the greatest challenge was organizing the screen so that the line, destination, frequency and arrows were aligned correctly on the same axis. 
By making sure I defined the width of the row, I was able to create some alignment.
I set the display in inline block across all three subjects in css and this solved the alignment problem. 
Playing around with the padding and margins for the destination also helped.
